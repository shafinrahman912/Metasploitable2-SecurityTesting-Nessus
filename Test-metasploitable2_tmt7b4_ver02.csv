weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.
Use TLS 1.2 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.","https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-ssl.pdf

(CVE-2008-0166)

== Who is affected ==

Systems which are running any of the following releases :

* Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty) * Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy) * Ubuntu 8.04
LTS (Hardy) * Ubuntu 'Intrepid Ibex' (development): libssl
<= 0.9.8g-8 * Debian 4.0 (etch) (see corresponding Debian
security advisory)

and have openssh-server installed or have been used to
create an OpenSSH key or X.509 (SSL) certificate.

All OpenSSH and X.509 keys generated on such systems must be
considered untrustworthy, regardless of the system on which
they are used, even after the update has been applied.

This includes the automatically generated host keys used by
OpenSSH, which are the basis for its server spoofing and
man-in-the-middle protection.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

"78479","CVE-2014-3566","4.3","Medium","192.168.133.129","tcp","5432","SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE)","It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host
with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the 
Fallback SCSV mechanism is not supported, allowing connections to be ""rolled 
back"" to SSLv3.

mitigate these problems, but newer versions of TLS like 1.2 and 1.3 are
designed against these flaws and should be used whenever possible.

As of March 31, 2020, Endpoints that aren’t enabled for TLS 1.2
and higher will no longer function properly with major web browsers and major vendors.

PCI DSS v3.2 requires that TLS 1.0 be disabled entirely by June 30,
2018, except for POS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination
points to which they connect) that can be verified as not being
susceptible to any known exploits.","Enable support for TLS 1.2 and 1.3, and disable support for TLS 1.0.","https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-00","TLSv1 is enabled and the server supports at least one cipher."

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","
